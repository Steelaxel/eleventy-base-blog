Hello world. I'm just writing to say hello as this is my first post using netlify. It has been quite an exciting journey and can't believe I can now build a static site. It has been quite intereting to see how fast I could build a site up with the help of 11ty.

## Learning curves

This is my first time using something like this so there has been some learning curves. However, with the help of the Coders Guild, I now have a site that is now up and running. It has been very interesting to see the changes I have made and get the overview on Github desktop. From there, I can commit changes, then voila! Changes are made quick and easy!
